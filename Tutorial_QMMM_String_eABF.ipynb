    "Using the results of the classical equillibration, we can setup and start the QM/MM SMD simulation. This SMD simulation uses a slight variation of the classical SMD, called \"conditional-SMD\" (cSMD), which was optimized to induce chemical reactions during QM/MM MD simulations. In this case, one atom is directed towards another during the simulations, much like the traditional SMD, but the direction in which it is pulled is constantly updated according to the movement of the targeted atom, and the force is only applied wile both atoms are separated by a cutoff. Once atoms are closer than the cutoff (which shoudl be slightly larger than the expected bond length), the force stops being applied. For reactions involving multiple bond formation this becomes especially relevant, since some bonds may form before others, and the conditional nature of cSMD will make the atoms stop being \"pushed\" once they form the bonds they are being induced to form.\n",

    "The following interactive plot allows a more precise analysis of the progression of the string optimization. Here you can compare the values of colvars plotted on the *X* and *Y* axis.\n",
    "For chemical reactions, such as the transfer of the Lysine 61 hydrogen atom to the OMP carbon, it is useful to compare two distances: the distance between the hydrogen and the Lysine nitrogen, and the distance between the hydrogen and the OMP carbon. As these distances change, their difference will show the chemical reaction taking place. In our example, the hydrogen from Lysine 61 binds to the carbon that looses the carboxylic group, so the distance between OMP's carbons 6 and 7 is also of interest. By plotting these two measures, we can track the progression of the reaction being studied."
